# Agent-sudo
# hello
In this write up we will look into the room "Agent-sudo" form TryHackMe,which we can be found below as well as on [Tryhackme](https://tryhackme.com).

The room is listed as an easy room, and covers a lot of different tools and aspects of security, which makes it a great room to complete for beginners.

An overview of what weâ€™ll be using is listed here:
+ Basic linux commands
+ nmap scan
+ curl
+ Hydra
+ John
+ Steghide
+ Linpeas


## Task 1

```bash
export IP= 10.10.98.58
```

## Task 2

Let's enumrate the machine. for this section we will need the following tools:
+ nmap
+ curl

1. How many open ports?

```
3
```

```bash
# To determine open ports we can use nmap:
sudo nmap  -sV -O -sC -oN nmap/intiatl $IP 
```
| Option | Descrption |
| ------ | ---------- |
| -sC | Default scripts. Nmap will use its default scripts to gather information |
| -sV | Version detection. Nmap will try to detect the versions of services running on open ports |
| -oN | Output format. Output as nmap format |
| -O | Operating detection |

2. How you redirect yourself to a secret page?

```
user-agent
```

```bash
# to change user-agent and redirect the page
curl "http://10.10.98.58/" -A "C" -L
```

3. What is the agent name?

```

| -e | to extract the files from the image |

```bash
# first we make the zip file to john hash
/opt/john/zip2john 8702.zip > hash_to_john
# second we use john to know the hash
/opt/john/john hash_to_john.txt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
#alien            (8702.zip/To_agentR.txt)
